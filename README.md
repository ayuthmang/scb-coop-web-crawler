# SCB COOP NET BOT

## Motivation

I'm too lazy to login to the website of [SCB CO-OP](https://scbcoop.scb.co.th/) and view my assets.
So I created this bot to do that by using [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to login and capture the screenshot of the page and save to the [screenshots](./screenshots/) folder.

Intentionally, I want this project to crawl all the details and returns JSON result only, not screenshot the entire page.

Unfortunately, the parsing process of the webpage is taking too much time. Therefore the screenshot comes in place.

I'd appreciated the pull request from the visitors. ðŸ‘€

Also, you can take a look what else you can contribute at the [Todo List](#todo-list) section.

```bash

## Setup the username and password

Copy `.env.example` to a new file called `.env` and update your username and password of the [SCB CO-OP](https://scbcoop.scb.co.th/) website.
